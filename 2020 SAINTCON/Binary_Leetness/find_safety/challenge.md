# Description

V is out for a walk in Night City. She must stay undercover and not bring any attention to herself. As she's walking along V sees The Orbitals above and must seek cover quickly. Ducking into a nearby alley, V comes across a locked door to an area where she can possibly hide. After banging on the door for a few seconds, V notices a small screen to the right of the door come to life with a virtual terminal and the text: `Enter Password`. V also notices a wire connector to the right of the terminal. Connecting to the terminal, V is able to access a copy of the `secure_door` program. This must be the software protecting the door. If only she can figure out the password from the binary, V can get to safety.
