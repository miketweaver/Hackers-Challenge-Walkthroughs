## Jup1t3r's Linux Commands Category

For this category, it is highly recommended that you have access to a unix-based operating system with general GNU utilities installed. I will be covering multiple utilities so that you can become more proficient with this important operating system's capabilities.

Installing Ubuntu in a VMWare instance is recommended for those without access to a linux or unix-based system. For most of what we do, MacOS, BSD, Linux, etc should work fine.

## Clue

The tr command, also known as the translate command is a versatile command that can be used to manipulate text. This utility can be used to "translate" characters from one to something else. Caesar would have enjoyed this utility if he had it back then.
