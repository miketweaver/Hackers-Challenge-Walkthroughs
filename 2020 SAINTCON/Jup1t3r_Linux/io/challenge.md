## Jup1t3r's Linux Commands Category

For this category, it is highly recommended that you have access to a unix-based operating system with general GNU utilities installed. I will be covering multiple utilities so that you can become more proficient with this important operating system's capabilities.

Installing Ubuntu in a VMWare instance is recommended for those without access to a linux or unix-based system. For most of what we do, MacOS, BSD, Linux, etc should work fine.

## Clue

The "file" command can be used to identify the contents of a file when you are unsure what it contains. This utility uses a database of known file-headers to peek at what is inside.
