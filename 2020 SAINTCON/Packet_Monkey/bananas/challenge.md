Use the PCAP attached to `Packet Monkey: Millions of Packets` to solve this challenge:

    Who would ever use an insecure protocol! What is the telnet password for R4?
    You captured some VLAN Trunking Protocol packets! What is the "VLAN Name" for VLAN 10?
    Good neighbors introduce themselves! What is the IPv4 management address of the switch that uses LLDP?

Now that you know these things, concatenate with + (plus sign) the 3 answers and submit that as your flag. eg. `password+SuperPrivateVLAN+203.0.113.13`
