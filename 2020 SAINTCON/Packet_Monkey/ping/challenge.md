Use the PCAP attached to `Packet Monkey: Millions of Packets` to solve this challenge:

    An iPhone user visited a website to find out what their public IPv6 address was. Well, what answer did they get?
    An email was captured! What email address was it sent to?

Now that you know these things, concatenate with + (plus sign) the 2 answers and submit that as your flag. eg. `203.0.113.42+hacker@example.com`
