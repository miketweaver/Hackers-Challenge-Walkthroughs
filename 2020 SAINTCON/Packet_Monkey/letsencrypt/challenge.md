# Description

Use the PCAP attached to `Packet Monkey: Millions of Packets` to solve this challenge:

    The funny thing about SNMPv2c, the community name is like a password shouted to everything you try to "discover". What community was shouted in this PCAP?

    Not many people still use IMAP with plain authentication, but someone in this capture did. What was their password?

Now that you know these things, concatenate with + (plus sign) the 2 answers and submit that as your flag. eg. `password+password`
