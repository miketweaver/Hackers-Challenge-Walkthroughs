Use the PCAP attached to `Packet Monkey: Millions of Packets` to solve this challenge:

    What is the hostname of the device that is requesting an IP address from DHCP?
    Someone asked DNS which mail server should be used. What was the reply, using FQDN?

Now that you know these things, concatenate with + (plus sign) the 2 answers and submit that as your flag. eg. `hostname+hostname`
