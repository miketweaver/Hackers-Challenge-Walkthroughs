# Description

To receive the flag for this challenge you must:

    Announce in the `#general` channel on discord that you are going to livestream a teaching moment. Tell us where to watch!
    Use the hashtags: `#hc #TeachIt` (if you forget them, you CAN NOT edit them in, they must be in the original post.)
    Livestream your teaching moment.
    Give a short tutorial on a tool of your choice that you have found helpful in hacking. Be it RedTeam, BlueTeam, HardwareHacking, SocialEngineering, physical or software, or something else. You choose, but empower us with a new knowledge of a tool.

    Receive a DM from the @HackersChallenge bot
